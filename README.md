## Project Description

PotPal is an Android application. The primary objective of this application is to streamline, simplify and enhance the process of caring for indoor plants. With this app, users can effortlessly add their plants to the tracker, and then the app will allow them to create their plant profile. By creating a plant profile, users can take a picture of the plant with the app, and PotPal will identify the plantâ€™s category (desert, cacti, tropical, etc.). Based on the category and environmental conditions the application will suggest personal care schedules. Users then are able to log care activities and the application will warn them if the plants are not getting the correct amount of water. Notifications will be used to remind the users about plant watering days.
